Documentation should include a brief description of: 
Corpus itself.
The data you have scraped.
Cleaning steps if you’ve done any.
Format of the files in the corpus (in this case, csv).
Mention of the terms and conditions under which you can access and use the data you scraped.

For Assignment 3, I was asked to scrape a website to extract information. To practise this, I used the website BooksToScrape. This functions as a mock online bookshop with all kinds of information about several hundreds of books.
